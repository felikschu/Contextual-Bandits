## Papers

### Survey Papers

*   [A Survey of Contextual Multi-armed Bandits](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.03326) - Li et al., 2010
*   [A Survey on Practical Applications of Multi-Armed and Contextual Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10040)-Djallel Bouneffouf, Irina Rish ,2019
   This article provides a comprehensive review of recent advancements in the application of the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to various real-world problems. It identifies common application areas of MABs, summarizes state-of-the-art techniques within each, highlights current trends in the field, and offers perspectives on the future direction of MAB research and applications. Essentially, it's a "state-of-the-union" address for MAB applications.
